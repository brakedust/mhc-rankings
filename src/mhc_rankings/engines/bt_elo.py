Bradley-Terry / Elo Ranking Engine

This module implements a hybrid ranking system combining the Elo rating system
with the Bradley-Terry model. 

1. **Bradley-Terry Model**: A probabilistic model that predicts the outcome of a paired
   comparison. Here, it is used to calculate the expected probability of Team A beating 
   Team B based on their current ratings. We use a standard logistic curve with a scale 
   factor of 400.
   
2. **Elo Update Mechanism**: After a game, the actual outcome is compared against the 
   expected probability. The team's rating is then adjusted. If a team performs better 
   than expected, they gain points; if worse, they lose points. 

3. **Margin of Victory Multiplier (MoVM)**: An optional enhancement that scales the rating
   exchange based on goal differential. It rewards blowouts but uses a logarithmic curve 
   to provide diminishing returns, preventing teams from endlessly running up the score.
   
The magnitude of the rating change is controlled by the `K-factor`. A higher K-factor 
makes the system more volatile (reactive to recent games), while a lower K-factor makes 
it more stable.
