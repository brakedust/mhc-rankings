Colley Matrix Ranking Engine

This module implements the Colley Matrix ranking system, a bias-free, mathematically 
robust method that models rankings as a system of linear equations: C * r = b.

- **Colley Matrix (C)**: Represents the schedule. Diagonal elements (C[i, i]) equal 2 plus 
  total games played. Off-diagonal elements (C[i, j]) equal the negative number of games 
  played between team i and team j.
- **Outcome Vector (b)**: Represents performance. b[i] = 1 + (Wins_i - Losses_i) / 2.
- **Solution (r)**: The resulting ratings vector.

Strength of Schedule (SOS) is computed as the average rating of a team's opponents.
